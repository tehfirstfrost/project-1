            <h1>A Journey</h1>
            <p>I dont have much to tell, no complex stories, just a past. Nor do I have any more images
                to add that are relavent, that was covered in the <span style="font-style:italic;">"About me The Visual"</span>.
                so i will be adding random thumnails. I am currently in the works of obtaining
                my goal of becoming a full stack developer. Sans that, I will be shooting for game development.
                I have always enjoyed building and working on things. Which includes electronics, as such just a few 
                months ago I completed building my gaming rig. As expected, it happens to be what i am using to build this
                site with.

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I am a High School graduate, I joined the military when I was in college. I will be returning
                    to college when I am able, hopfully within the year. I attended a Charter High School, so I was able
                    to skip grades and graduate early. I also took classes from the local community college while I was
                    in HS. I will never regret droping out to join the military, I was able to go places, do things, and 
                    meet people, that I would never of been able to without joining. I look at it now as a crafted 
                    hurdle to make myself better by obtaining a degree later in life when life is more complicated.
                    Not as easily coasted through as it would of been if I stayed in.

                <h2>Past Work</h2>
                <p> There isnt much to list in my past work, the most noteable being; Service Truck
                    Foreman (service electrician).
                    <br>
                    I have had several different kinds of jobs: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utility technition (glorified laborer)</li>
                        <li>Lube tech (shop monkey and oil changes)</li>
                        <li>Lead Sales (customer service / sales)</li>
                        <li>19D (Army CAV Scout)</li>
                        <li>Electrician (apprentic through Foreman)</li>
                    </ul>

                    The different job duties, and walks of life, have given me a more rounded outlook. Which can be
                    benificial when it comes to challenges that I may encounter in day to day life. Aswell as thinking
                    out side the box that society has willingly jumped into with there social media. Constricting how they
                    see things and amass the same though patterns. Slowly becoming on mass of blankness.
